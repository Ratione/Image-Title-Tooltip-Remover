# Image-Title-Tooltip-Remover

This script waits for you to hover over an 'img' object, and then temporarily sets the title of that image to '' so it doesnt pop up an annoying tooltip. Useful for image enlargers, among other things.

I made this because some sitesuse thumbnail images as links to larger pictures. Some particularly lazy programmers deided to make the `title` of their thumbnail just the plaintext meta-data of the large image they are linking to, which can lead to massive text boxes when you hover over an image. 

To use, Install the js file with Your flavor of GreaseMonkey, and then include or match it to the site you want.
